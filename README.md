# CEO-Topic-Classifier-Extractor

> > Our society is currently run by some of the worlds largest and smartest technology
companies. Where each of these companies have a vision and impact on the world due to the
views of their CEO. But how do the views between these CEOs differ? What are the topics that
these CEOs are constantly concerned with and are expressing their opinions? Within this study
we shall collect tweets from selected CEOs, determine if we are able to identify the tweetâ€™s
originator correctly, and extract the topic of each tweet to have a collection of concerns that each
CEO has. From there the analysis can be furthered by calculating the distance between the issues
that the CEOs talk about and have an understanding of how closely related their concerns are.

> > Conducting our analysis through the assistance of an classification algorithm will aid in
our research concerning the topics that CEOs primarily tweet about. The specific algorithm that
will be performed in this research will be Support Vector Machines, which is known to be useful
in the classification of images, bioinformatics, and text categorization. Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) are going to be useful determining which CEOs a tweet belong to, and we will be
utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract prominent topics among the classified tweets.
Through the usage of both these techniques, we strive to accomplish our goal of classifying
tweets and finding the common topics discussed among CEOs. By the end of this research we
shall attempt to distinguish the difference between topics of CEOs, the similarities/differences,
and the number of times a specific topic is tweeted.
